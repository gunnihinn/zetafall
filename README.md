# Zetafall

Zetafall is my personal blog.

## Use

I use AsciiDoctor to render a static HTML page. Execute

    make

to render `index.html.` To publish a post, execute:

    make post

## Licence

I don't think I wrote any software for this, but if you want to reuse the
Makefile or the general idea, let's say this is under BSD-3.
